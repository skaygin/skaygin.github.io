I am a coder, software architect and lecturer. You can visit 
[my web site](https://serkankaygin.com/) to have more information.

I also take notes to my
[blog](https://blog.serkankaygin.com/)
as I learn things. There is a search facility, and you can also access them by date, categories or tags.


You can visit my
[github](https://github.com/skaygin)
